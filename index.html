<p>Globalization has great implications for young Chinese.For example,young farmers are moving on a large scale to urban areas to look for jobs.And for those young people who aspire to study abroad or work in foreign-invested enterprises.English has become increasingly important.At the same time, a considerable number of overseas Chinese students have returned home in recent years,for they hold an optimistic outlook for the long-term growth of the Chinese economy.The Internet has strengthened the links between Chinese young people and those elsewhere .They follow the latest trend and copy foreign fashions.Some of them don’t seem to care for traditional Chinese virtues,let alone carry them forward,which has given rise to worries that the traditional culture might one day vanish.</p>

<p>Today we are under constant pressure to work longer hours to produce more,and to possess more.Lots of people hold the wrong perception that happiness lies in working hard and earning well.Many women today feel the same stress to work and get ahead and ,at the same time ,to nurture their offspring and shoulder the burden of domestic responsibilities.Research shows that workaholism tends to distance us from our immediate families.It forces us to toil longer and longer hour leaving a minute fraction of out time to be physically and emotionally available to our loved ones.Intimacy among family members is doomed to die in the process.</p>

<p>Today, long after the earthquake hit my home town, I can still recall, in crystal detail, what I saw as I ran out of my home with my parents. The building just across the street toppled right before our eyes, debris flew every where and a cloud of choking dust blotted out the sun. Horror-stricken people ran in all directions, crying and screaming. Now, many years after that tragic event, a new town has risen on the wreckage of the old one. In the town square, a memorial has been built to remember those killed in the disaster. It seems the wounds in people’s hearts have healed, but the memory will linger.</p>
